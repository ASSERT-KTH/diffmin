# diffmin

In a software development process based on code reviews, the visualization of the diff between the base, and the target
branch is of utmost importance. It is known that spurious formatting changes pollute code reviews and lead to
unnecessary communication and code review work. Today, the only solution for minimizing the diff is one that ignores
white spaces. This project will aim to automatically minimize pull requests by keeping only the AST changes.
