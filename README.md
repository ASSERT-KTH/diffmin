# diffmin

In a software development process based on code reviews, the visualization of 
the diff between the base, and the target branch is of utmost importance. It is
known that spurious formatting changes pollute code reviews and lead to
unnecessary communication and code review work. Today, the only solution for
minimizing the diff is one that ignores white spaces. This project will aim to
automatically minimize pull requests by keeping only the AST changes.
